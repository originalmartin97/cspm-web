## ActualityCardCarousel Component Improvements

### Navigation Button Issues Fixed

1. **Mobile Navigation Buttons**
   - Fixed issue where mobile navigation buttons weren't working properly
   - Resolved by ensuring buttons use the correct handler functions (`handlePrevCard`/`handleNextCard`)
   - Added proper event propagation handling to prevent unintended behavior

2. **Modal Navigation Issues**
   - Fixed persistent issue with desktop modal navigation buttons disappearing
   - Implemented document-level mouse movement tracking for better button visibility
   - Modified `handleModalMouseLeave` to be less aggressive - only hide buttons when mouse leaves the window
   - Added fixed positioning to buttons to ensure they stay visible
   - Set minimum opacity (30%) for buttons even when not hovered
   - Increased z-index to 1500 to ensure buttons remain above other content

3. **Mouse Position Detection**
   - Enhanced edge detection algorithm
   - Increased edge detection threshold to be more user-friendly
   - Added window-relative position tracking in addition to modal-relative tracking

### Swipe Navigation Improvements

- Updated mobile carousel to use horizontal swipe matching mobile UX conventions
- Maintained vertical swipe for desktop
- Ensured consistent directional behavior between:
  - Regular carousel view
  - Modal view
  - Mobile view
  - Desktop view

### Content Loading

- Fixed issue where keyboard navigation in the modal would change content but not update display
- Ensured proper content loading with the `handleModalNavigationCallback` function
- Added proper dependencies to useEffect hooks to prevent stale closures

### Data Display Improvements

- **Added reverse chronological order sorting for actualities**
  - Implemented sorting by ID in descending order in `actualityData.js`
  - Ensures newest content (with highest ID) appears first in the carousel
  - Makes new announcements immediately visible to users without requiring code structure changes
  - Improves content management workflow by allowing simple ID-based ordering
  - Future-proofed the solution - simply adding new items with higher IDs ensures correct ordering

### Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed ESLint warnings by:
  - Adding proper dependencies to useEffect hooks
  - Using useCallback for memoization of handler functions
  - Fixing duplicate 'display' property in Typography component
- Enhanced code comments for better maintainability
- Improved event handler organization

### User Experience Enhancements

- Added improved visual hints for:
  - Mobile swipe navigation
  - Desktop modal navigation
  - Button visibility states
- Ensured buttons remain somewhat visible even when not actively hovered
- Added brief visual guidance that appears when modal opens

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more visual feedback for interactions
- Evaluate performance impact of document-level event listeners
- Consider pre-loading content for faster navigation
- Add more extensive accessibility features
